      <h1>What is MISS_HIT?</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      MISS_HIT is several things, but most importantly it is a set of
      tools that will <i>make your code better</i> (and hopefully your
      life easier) if you are writing programs using the MATLAB,
      Simulink, or Octave programming languages. To be honest, I wrote
      MISS_HIT out of frustration, in that there is a huge MATLAB
      eco-system in industry, and the code quality is generally poor
      as there is little to no tool-support that is taken for granted
      in any other programming language. So MISS_HIT attempts to fill
      the gaps with the following tools:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>MH Style</b> - A configurable style checker and code
          formatter (sometimes also called code beautifier or pretty
          printer). It can take any MATLAB or Octave code and fix
          e.g. indentation and other style problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MH Metrics</b> - A code metrics tool, that can produce a
          variety of complexity metrics for your code. It includes a
          justification mechanism so that you can use this tool in CI,
          and HTML reports.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MH Lint</b> - A bug-finding static analysis tool, that
          can detect some questionable, ambiguous, or misleading
          constructs in your code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MH Copyright</b> - A tool that can simplify maintaining
          and updating copyright notices and docstrings in your code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Please note that all these tools also support updating MATLAB
      code embedded inside Simulink models.

      <h1>Example</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      The style checker can turn code like this:
      <pre>function rv= foo (x), if x &lt; 0,,rv=-   x;else,rv=x;,; end;</pre>
      Into something more readable:
<pre>
function rv = foo (x)
    if x &lt; 0
        rv = -x;
    else
        rv = x;
    end
</pre>
    </section>

      <div>
        The easiest way to install it is to use the latest release
        published on PyPI:
        <pre>$ pip3 install miss_hit</pre>

        Then, you can style-check your program, by simply using:
        <pre>$ mh_style --fix my_program.m</pre>

        Please refer to
        the <a href="https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/">online
        documentation</a> on GitHub for more details.

      <h1>What makes MISS_HIT good?</h1>
    </div>

    <section>
      <div>
        There have been other attempts at this, but MISS_HIT tries to
        do things differently (and I hope better). Specifically:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It is completely stand-alone. It does not require a
            working MATLAB or Octave setup.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is not just a bag of reg-ex, or a wrapper arounds some
            undocumented MATLAB internals. It is based on a feature
            complete lexer and parser, which
            supports <a href="https://github.com/florianschanda/miss_hit/blob/master/LEXING_ISSUES.md">every
            single weird feature</a> of the MATLAB language.
          </li>
          <li>
            It contains features specifically for huge industrial
            code-bases (i.e. millions of lines): multi-threaded
            analysis and a
            sophisticated <a href="https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/configuration.html">configuration</a>
            and <a href="https://florianschanda.github.io/miss_hit/pragmas.html">justification</a>
            mechanism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed for both interactive use during development, and
            integration into modern CI environments.
          </li>
        </ul>
